> Verdict: **PASS_WITH_RESIDUALS**

## Closure Question 1: Non-Mock Coverage

**Do we have full unit/integration coverage without mocks/fakes?**

Yes, with quantified residuals. 169 test files classified (32 unit, 113 VCR, 24 E2E). Non-mock compliance gate passes (19 checks). Test double inventory: 267 entries across 21 modules. 7 allowlisted exceptions documented with owner and replacement plan. 3 tracked for active migration (Recording*/MockHostActions via bd-m9rk), 4 permanent with rationale.

Evidence:
- `docs/non-mock-rubric.json`
- `docs/test_double_inventory.json`
- `docs/testing-policy.md (Allowlisted Exceptions)`
- `tests/non_mock_compliance_gate.rs (19 tests pass)`

Residuals:
- 3 recording doubles tracked for migration (bd-m9rk)
- 132 high-risk entries in inventory (mostly extension_dispatcher inline stubs)
- model_selector_cycling uses DummyProvider (known, tracked)

## Closure Question 2: E2E Logging

**Do we have complete E2E integration scripts with detailed logging?**

Yes. 11/12 E2E workflows covered (92%), 1 waived (live-only, requires credentials). 24 E2E test files classified. Structured logging: failure_digest.v1, failure_timeline.v1, evidence_contract.json, replay_bundle.v1. CI gate lanes: preflight fast-fail + full certification. Waiver lifecycle enforced. Replay bundles with environment context.

Evidence:
- `docs/e2e_scenario_matrix.json`
- `scripts/e2e/run_all.sh`
- `tests/ci_full_suite_gate.rs (12 tests pass)`
- `tests/e2e_replay_bundles.rs (10 tests pass)`
- `docs/qa-runbook.md`
- `docs/ci-operator-runbook.md`

Residuals:
- 1 waived workflow (live provider parity, requires credentials)
- 1 CI gate failure (cross_platform), 3 skipped (missing conformance artifacts)
- Evidence bundle only generated during full E2E runs

## Suite Classification

| Suite | Files |
|-------|-------|
| Unit | 32 |
| VCR | 113 |
| E2E | 24 |
| **Total** | **169** |

## Allowlisted Exceptions

| Identifier | Owner | Status | Plan |
|------------|-------|--------|------|
| `MockHttpServer` | infra | accepted | Permanent: VCR cannot represent invalid UTF-8 bytes |
| `MockHttpRequest` | infra | accepted | Permanent: companion to MockHttpServer |
| `MockHttpResponse` | infra | accepted | Permanent: companion to MockHttpServer |
| `PackageCommandStubs` | infra | accepted | Permanent: real npm/git non-deterministic |
| `RecordingSession` | bd-m9rk | tracked | Replace with SessionHandle (most usages migrated) |
| `RecordingHostActions` | bd-m9rk | tracked | Evaluate agent-loop integration replacement |
| `MockHostActions` | bd-m9rk | tracked | Replace with real session-based dispatch |

## Residual Gaps

| ID | Severity | Follow-up | Description |
|-----|----------|-----------|-------------|
| cross_platform_gate | medium | bd-1f42.6.7 | Cross-platform matrix gate fails (platform_report.json incomplete) |
| ext_conformance_artifacts | low | bd-1f42.4.4 | Extension conformance gate artifacts not present in local runs (requires ext-conformance feature) |
| evidence_bundle_artifact | low | bd-1f42.6.8 | Evidence bundle index.json only generated during full E2E runs |
| recording_doubles_cleanup | low | bd-m9rk | RecordingSession/RecordingHostActions/MockHostActions tracked for migration to real sessions |
| live_provider_parity | low | bd-1f42.8.5.3 | Live provider parity workflows waived (require live credentials) |
